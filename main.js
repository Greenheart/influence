/**
 * Influence - Game design and development ideas
 * 
 * PRIORITY
 * 
 * TODO: add game board with 7x7 (areas of influence)
 * TODO: click to make square red / blue depending on which player's turn it is (simple version)
 * TODO: 1) click to select your own area, then 2) click a green or yellow square to expand your influence.
 * TODO: Clearly show if it's the red or blue player's turn using text in the top center of the screen.
 * TODO: When a zone is moved, try to conquer areas with the current player's influence
 * TODO: add player scores based on current number of areas
 * TODO: update player scores after each turn
 * TODO: add endgame conditions to determine the winner
 * TODO: make it possible to restart the game
 * TODO: add bonus area in the middle with higher score if you conquer it
 * 
 * 
 * FUTURE IDEAS (LOWER PRIO)
 *
 * TODO: Show bonus areas with a special indicator next to the player's turn.
 * TODO: Add animations to make the interactions feel super smooth!
 * TODO: count the number of turns each match takes to finish and display at the end
