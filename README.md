> A simple game to teach JS, HTML and CSS.

Inspired by [Iso Conquest](https://github.com/Greenheart/iso-conquest)

## 1. Learn basics of HTML, CSS, JS @ freeCodeCamp.org

## 2. Setup Local Dev Environment

- Create a GitHub account
- Install VS Code
- Install Node.js
- Install extensions to VS Code: 
    - `esbenp.prettier-vscode` (Super useful for code readability)
        - Make sure to also enable format on save in the editor.
    - `coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer-2`
        - Improves readability
    - `zhuangtongfa.material-theme`
        - Optional, but required according to the cool kids!
    - `ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare`
        - For collaborative pair- or mob programming just like Google Docs!

## 3. Create this game from scratch

### 3.1 Basic setup

Run `npm init vite@latest` and follow the prompts to create the project structure.

Create the GitHub repository / or use this one.

Discuss the game parts and create a strategy for how to create it.

Implement the different parts.

Publish early and often to a live webpage. Make sure the game works on mobile phones to make it easy to share and play.
